# Libra
The Libra project is inspired by the C64 game Libra - you can find material about it [here](http://www.gamebase64.com/game.php?h=0&id=4371) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KfHnlf-Nso). It uses [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net) and a fork of [Nez](https://github.com/KamiNeko/Nez) as underlying frameworks. 

## Requirements
* Windows (MonoGame supports multiple OS, but I only test on this one, so there is no guarantee it will work on Mac oder Linux)
* MonoGame 3.5.1
* Visual Studio 2017
* [Aseprite](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite), if you want to open / edit the sprite files

## Build
* Open the project in Visual Studio
* If you get the nuget error message of *kamineko.nez* not found, try to activate the *include prerelease* option
